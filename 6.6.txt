In hadoop 1.x all the operations such as utilization and job monitoring are monitored by job tracker 
In 2.x this is handeled by splitting the task to resource manager,node manager and the application manager.
The number nodes that can be fit into the cluster has been scaled up from 4000 to 10000.
hadoop 2.x also support other processing models other than map reduce model
In hadoop 2.x resource allocation nis dyanamic
In hadoop 1.x mapreduce processing model is submitted where in 2.x other processing model is also submitted
