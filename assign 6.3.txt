Explain the working of below pig script commands with an example:
1. LOAD - loads data from file system
          ex: l1 = load '/home/acadgild/si' using PigStorage(',') as (date,tem);  

2. STORE - stores or saves results to file system
           ex: Store l1 into '/home/acadgild/ll1);

3. DUMP - displays results to screen
           ex: dump l1;

4. FOREACH - Generates data transformations based on columns of data
             ex: ff1 = foreach l1 GENERATE date;

5. FILTER - Selects tuples from a relation based on some condition
            ex:

			f1 = FILTER l1 by tem> 23;
  			dump f1;

6. GROUP BY - Groups the data in one or multiple relations
              

		gb = GROUP l1 BY tem;
		DUMP gb;
		
7. ORDER BY - Sorts a relation based on one or more fields
            
		ro = ORDER l1 BY tem DESC;
		DUMP ro;
		


8. DESCRIBE - Returns the schema of an alias
              ex: describe l1;
